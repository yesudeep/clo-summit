        <p>Transformation begins with learning. Without learning we continue to operate from the present structure of thinking and action. In a rapidly changing environment this leaves us archaic and dysfunctional. Continuous renewal is the only trail to sustainable success. This is as true for organizations as it is for individuals.</p>

        <p>Learning is no more optional for the corporations. Learning is beyond training. In a competitive scenario, learning is a new business function that helps Organisation to continuously convert ideas into actionable business outcomes, innovations into new products and imagination to constantly raise the bar of performance. CLO is a new business manager, a new crusader to constantly prepare Organisation to meet talent competition.</p>

        <p>Learning is elemental in the success of any organization. Learning organizations engender and leap in new-fangled ideas and erudition. The wherewithal of companies to do so helps them to stay ahead of competition. The role of the CLO in this context is to understand the existing and emerging business challenges for their organizations and ensure the learning resources and agendas to get to the bottom of the catch.</p>
        <p>The CLO Summit will provide an excellent platform to listen to what various businesses talk about it.</p>
